# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

### Description
The A* (A-Star) algorithm is implemented in C++ for finding the shortest path in a grid, utilizing heuristics to optimize search efficiency. A* is commonly applied in artificial intelligence and game development due to its effectiveness in pathfinding tasks.

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   g++ -o astar src/astar.cpp main.cpp -I include/
   ./astar
   ```

### Features
- Heuristic Optimization: Uses customizable heuristics to enhance search speed.
- Grid Navigation: Designed for grid-based pathfinding; adaptable to different grid sizes and obstacles.
